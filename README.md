# NFA to REGEX

Converts a nondeterministic finite accepter to a regular expression.

## Introduction
A Nondeterministic Finite Acceptor (NFA) is a finite state machine that reads in a string as input and either can accept or reject it. Unlike deterministic finite acceptors, a NFA is nondeterministic meaning the machine at times can have a choice for its next state given an input. An example of a finite state machine is given below in figure below.
